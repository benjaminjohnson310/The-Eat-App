About Me

My name is Benjamin Johnson. I am a Revenue Specialist at a company called Enablecomp. I have been an Enablecomp employee for 5 years. I am currently a student at Pivot Tech School. I In 2011, I received an associates of applied science degree from Medvance Institute, now know as Fortes Institute. The degree is for Information Technology Biomedical Technician. My goal was to get a job in a hospital or medical clinic maintaining and repairing medical equipment as well as computers. Unable to land a career in that field, I decided to go back to school to learn software development. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully this will get me started in the field of software engineering.
